In our group project, we developed a single-page application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), incorporating a GraphQL API for efficient data queries and mutations, and JWT for user authentication. Starting from scratch, we focused on creating a secure, user-centric platform that addresses real-world challenges. By leveraging agile methodologies, GitHub for code management, and project management tools for collaboration, we enhanced our front-end and server-side skills. This project not only honed our problem-solving abilities but also provided a practical experience in full-stack development within a team setting, preparing us to tackle real-world data demands effectively.
